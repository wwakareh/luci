Lucy was a lady who worked at companyx.  She left from Puerto Rico to Orlando leaving companyx customers unattended and her desk desolate.
So LUCI was made to take care of the backlog of work.  It is an AI bot made using the Microsoft Bot Framework and the GFR Media API to fetch information and create context of the users that used to write to Lucy.  Lucy now lives in Kissimee Florida while LUCI reduces backlog of work.  

The USE CASE showcased is a chatbot that responds to the users'questions.
